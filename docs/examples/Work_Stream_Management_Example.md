# Work Stream Management Example

This document provides a practical example of using the work stream management process. It demonstrates how to organize tasks, update status, and manage branch-specific work.

## Example: Adding a New Feature

### Step 1: Create a branch and update WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b implement-feature-x

# Edit WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md to add your section
```

Add your section to WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md following this format:

```markdown
## Branch: [implement-feature-x]

Implementation of Feature X to enable better workflow integration.

### Stage 1: Requirements
- [ ] **Create requirements document** [implement-feature-x] (High Priority)
  - [ ] Define feature X scope and parameters
  - [ ] Document API interfaces
  - [ ] Include example usage

### Stage 2: Implementation
- [ ] **Build feature core functionality** [implement-feature-x] (High Priority)
  - [ ] Implement core modules
  - [ ] Add configuration options
  - [ ] Handle edge cases

### Stage 3: Testing
- [ ] **Develop tests for feature X** [implement-feature-x] (Medium Priority)
  - [ ] Create unit tests for core functionality
  - [ ] Add integration tests

### Stage 4: Documentation
- [ ] **Document feature X for end users** [implement-feature-x] (Medium Priority)
  - [ ] Add usage examples to README
  - [ ] Update API documentation

### Completed in this Branch
- [x] **Branch setup** (2025-03-05)
  - [x] Create branch and task definition
```

### Step 2: Submit a PR for just the task list

Create a PR that updates only the WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md file:

```bash
git add WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
git commit -S -s -m "Add work stream tasks for feature-x implementation

- Add new branch section with prioritized tasks
- Define scope and initial implementation plan

This PR only updates the work stream tracking document."
git push -u origin implement-feature-x
```

Create a PR on GitHub with a clear title: "Add feature-x work stream to task tracking"

### Step 3: Work on your feature

Begin implementing your feature according to the defined tasks. As you make progress:

```bash
# Update WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md to reflect progress
git checkout implement-feature-x
```

Edit WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md to update your section:

```markdown
### Stage 1: Requirements
- [x] **Create requirements document** (2025-03-07) [implement-feature-x]
  - [x] Define feature X scope and parameters
  - [x] Document API interfaces
  - [x] Include example usage

### Stage 2: Implementation
- [ ] **Build feature core functionality** [implement-feature-x] (High Priority)
  - [ ] Implement core modules
  - [ ] Add configuration options
  - [ ] Handle edge cases

### Stage 3: Testing
- [ ] **Develop tests for feature X** [implement-feature-x] (Medium Priority)
  - [ ] Create unit tests for core functionality
  - [ ] Add integration tests

### Stage 4: Documentation
- [ ] **Document feature X for end users** [implement-feature-x] (Medium Priority)
  - [ ] Add usage examples to README
  - [ ] Update API documentation

### Completed in this Branch
- [x] **Branch setup** (2025-03-05)
  - [x] Create branch and task definition
- [x] **Requirements documentation** (2025-03-07)
  - [x] Defined feature scope and parameters
  - [x] Documented interfaces and examples
```

### Step 4: Submit a status update PR

Create a PR just for the status update:

```bash
git add WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
git commit -S -s -m "Update feature-x work stream status

- Mark requirements documentation as complete
- Add completion date (2025-03-07)
- Move completed task to Completed section

This PR only updates the status in the task tracking document."
git push
```

Create a PR on GitHub with title: "Update feature-x work stream status"

### Step 5: Complete the feature implementation

After your feature is implemented, update WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md one final time:

```markdown
### Completed in this Branch
- [x] **Branch setup** (2025-03-05)
  - [x] Create branch and task definition
- [x] **Requirements documentation** (2025-03-07)
  - [x] Defined feature scope and parameters
  - [x] Documented interfaces and examples
- [x] **Implementation of feature X** (2025-03-10)
  - [x] Core functionality implementation
  - [x] Integration with existing systems
- [x] **Testing for feature X** (2025-03-12)
  - [x] Unit tests for core functionality
  - [x] Integration tests
- [x] **Documentation for end users** (2025-03-14)
  - [x] Added usage examples to README
  - [x] Updated API documentation
```

Include this final status update in your feature implementation PR.

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Visibility**: All team members can see what's happening across branches
- **Organization**: Clear task prioritization and ownership
- **History**: Creates a record of branch activities and completion dates
- **Collaboration**: Makes it easier to coordinate between branches
- **Tracking**: Provides a central view of project progress
